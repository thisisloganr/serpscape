This program requires the Selenium library, here are [instructions for installation](https://shanyitan.medium.com/how-to-install-selenium-and-run-it-successfully-via-jupyter-lab-c3f50d22a0d4), thank you [Shan Yi Tan!](https://github.com/shanyi1023)

Make a copy of the Google Sheet referenced in the 'fp' variable, make it shareable to 'Anyone with link can view', and replace the URL in the variable value. This enables you to add/remove the screenshots, descriptors, and destination for the image file drops without having to further modify the code.

*Bonus points* for setting it up in Task Scheduler to automatically grab screenshots on a user-defined cadence.
